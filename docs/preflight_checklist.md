## Testing Steps

1. Run verification:

```bash
# Run setup verification
python scripts/verify_setup.py

# Run test suite
pytest tests/
```

2. Run single-device test:

```bash
# Test on single device first
python train.py --config configs/distributed_config.json --single-device
```

3. Run distributed test:

```bash
# On primary device
python train.py --config configs/distributed_config.json --primary

# On secondary device
python train.py --config configs/distributed_config.json --secondary
```

4. Monitor training:

```bash
# Open dashboard
http://localhost:8050

# Check logs
tail -f logs/training.log
```

## Performance Verification

1. Memory Usage:

```bash
# Check Metal memory usage
python3 -c "
import mlx.core as mx
print(f'Active Memory: {mx.metal.get_active_memory() / (1024**3):.2f} GB')
print(f'Peak Memory: {mx.metal.get_peak_memory() / (1024**3):.2f} GB')
"
```

2. Network Performance:

```bash
# Test network bandwidth
iperf3 -c secondary-device.local

# Expected: >10Gbps
```

3. GPU Utilization:

```bash
# Monitor GPU usage
python3 -c "
import mlx.core as mx
import time
while True:
    print(f'GPU Utilization: {mx.metal.get_active_memory() / mx.metal.get_memory_limit():.2%}')
    time.sleep(1)
"
```

## Common Issues

1. Memory Errors:
   - [ ] Reduce batch size
   - [ ] Enable gradient checkpointing
   - [ ] Clear Metal cache

   ```bash
   python3 -c "import mlx.core as mx; mx.metal.clear_cache()"
   ```

2. Network Issues:
   - [ ] Verify SSH connectivity
   - [ ] Check network speed
   - [ ] Adjust timeout settings

   ```bash
   # Test SSH connection
   ssh -v secondary-device.local
   ```

3. Performance Issues:
   - [ ] Monitor GPU utilization
   - [ ] Check memory usage
   - [ ] Verify gradient synchronization

   ```bash
   # Run benchmark
   python scripts/benchmark.py
   ```
